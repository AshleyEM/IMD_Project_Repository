My species, in our larval form, are big fans of fine dining, especially on the flowers of Magnolia stellata, or magnolia trees. Adults, like me, feed on nectar from most flowering plants. Springtime is prime time for my favorite meal to bloom. This past spring, however, has been super cold...hello winter number two. This means that the magnolias haven’t been able to bloom as gloriously. I need you to help me find some lush magnolias please! Keep in mind, I eat other plants too, maybe you can help me find ones with flowers. My friend Piña the Pinecone is also out here somewhere. Maybe we’ll cross paths with her. Start off your exploration by venturing to the Winter Garden. Good luck!",

Because of the drier summers, we couldn’t keep up with the lack of water reaching us. The beetles ate through our bark to reach our phloem, and the trees could not handle all the stress. Since 2005, about 40 of us at the Arboretum have been infested with beetles. Our trunks are sturdy and rigid, the rigida moniker isn’t a lie, but after droughts and beetle attacks, even our mighty bodies are taken down. I need your help. I need you to go through the Arboretum and help me find one of my surviving family members. Along the way, you’ll see lots of other plants. Hopefully, seeing these living, lush plants will encourage you to learn about all of them while they are alive, learn about biodiversity, and what YOU can do to help preserve plants!

You can take your knowledge and apply it at home in your community. You can read up about plant care and start your own garden, responsibly planting a variety of lush plants is a great way to add to the biodiversity of your area. You can talk to the lovely folks at the Arboretum about further learning opportunities as well! Visit arboretumfoundation.org for more info.",
