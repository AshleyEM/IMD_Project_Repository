My species, in our larval form, are big fans of fine dining, especially on the flowers of Magnolia stellata, or magnolia trees. Adults, like me, feed on nectar from most flowering plants. Springtime is prime time for my favorite meal to bloom. This past spring, however, has been super cold...hello winter number two. This means that the magnolias haven’t been able to bloom as gloriously. I need you to help me find some lush magnolias please! Keep in mind, I eat other plants too, maybe you can help me find ones with flowers. My friend Piña the Pinecone is also out here somewhere. Maybe we’ll cross paths with her. Start off your exploration by venturing to the Winter Garden. Good luck!",
