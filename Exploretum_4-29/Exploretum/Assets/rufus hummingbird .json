					"Narrative": "Hey there Explorer, nice to meet you, can you see me up here hovering around? I can be hard to miss. My name’s Rufus, and I’m a rufous hummingbird. I’m not really from around here.... 
					
					I’ve been travelling for so long now, I’ve migrated up to the PNW from Mexico. I still have quite a ways to go, I’m actually heading to Alaska for the season. All this travelling makes me extremely hungry, and my small self needs flower nectar to survive.
					
					Some flowering plants throughout the Arboretum may have bloomed early due to changes in climate, so I need you to help me find plants that are currently in bloom and not too frost-bitten. Hopefully we can find a feast, and you can learn about the incredible plants that are all around you!"

					You can help migrating species like me by planting a diversity of plants in your own garden.",
