Our trunks are sturdy and rigid, the rigida moniker isn’t a lie, but after droughts and beetle attacks, even our mighty bodies are taken down. I need your help.

I hope along the way I have more flowers to eat. This shows us that the diversity of plants is super important for animals like me. You can help migrating species like me by planting a diversity of plants in your own garden."
