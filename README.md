# Exploretum

An Android app that guides users through the Washington Park Arboretum. The app uses GPS coordinates to lead the user to different plants within the park via a "hot-cold" meter. Once they reach a stop, the app provides infromation about the plant.

'Exploretum_Final' is the final version. 'Exploretum_Crow' was a temporary version to test GPS navigation.
